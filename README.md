# Unity-Games
These were completed by following a Udemy Course online. More will be added as I complete the Udemy course "Learn to Code by Making Games" found here: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/overview

##How to run  
Clone the repository and open the project in Unity. The easiest way to open it in Unity is navigating to the Assets folder of a game and opening the scene. This works in at least Unity version 4.0 on up to the most recent release.

## Games
### NumberWizard-UnityGame  
Very simple Unity console based game where the computer guesses the user's number between 1 and 1000.  The console will be where the game takes place.

### Text101
Simple text based adventure where player tries to escape a prison.
